                    <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>

                    <p>
                        Since the fall of 2024, I have been a part of the <em>BU Red Cross</em> community. My primary role involves 
                        assisting with the sign-in process for blood donors by verifying their identities and ensuring 
                        accurate entries in our system. I also engage with individuals to raise awareness about the 
                        importance of donating blood. <br><br>

                        Additionally, I was involved with <em>Minds Matter Boston (MMB)</em> from the fall of 2019 to the spring of 2022, where 
                        I participated as a mentee. During that time, I attended weekly workshops focused on college preparation and 
                        career development. <br><br>

                        I'm currently collaborating with friends to create a gym club for BU students where people can connect with others who 
                        share a similar work ethic and be productive.
